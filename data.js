      "My trip to Montreal really made me miss my years living in Europe, I'm also happy that my little bit of French I learnt in highschool came in handy. We stayed at an hotel in Old Montreal. Travelling by the Metro was easy to navigate. We saw whole city from Mount Royal, visited Notre-Dame Basilica, felt like I transported from Europe to Asia in the Botanical Garden, and learnt  a lot about how our future could look like from The Biodome. Schwartz's Deli smoked meat sandwich was the best!",

      'I currently live in Toronto, and I love this city from the moment I arrived here. I feel like this city is made for me. I love that there is diversity everywhere, people of mixed cultures, races, ethnicity just like myself. I enjoy that the city kept a lot of greenspaces and of all, my favorite place in this city is Toronto Island where you can see the beautiful skyline of the city.',

      "It might not look like it, but I grew up in Greece before moving to Canada. My parents still live in Greece and I've explored every end of Athens. Athens is full of history, anyone visiting Athens should visit the Acropolis, the Acropolis Museum, the Parthenon. These 3 are the only must pay places to visit, for the rest of your time, you should roam around the city, buy yourself some amazing gyros sold in any corner and drink a Greek Frappe. Yes, Greece has the most beautiful islands, but Athens is the place for history fans.",

      'The legend of the Trevi Fountain says that you should stand with your back to the fountain and toss a coin over your shoulder to guarantee a return trip to Rome. I guess it worked since this is my 2nd time to Italy, but my first time travelling alone. There is a different feeling traveling alone but glad to explore Rome and Vatican City. Rome is a beautiful city and I can imagine living here. The whole city felt like an open museum. I walked 30KM in one day and found many beautiful spots. May I say that definately the pizza was amazing.',

      "Singapore is the most beautifully futuristic place I've visited. When I was younger, I thought the the future will be mostly skyscrapers and lots of grey colour, Singapore gave me hope on how the future could look like. It feels very futuristic while also it also keeps it's greenspace to show that the future can be modern and environmentally sustainable. The perfect balance of being in the City and in Nature. The 'Gardens by the Bay' was my favorite place and Marina Bay at night is a whole different beauty.",

I planted rice in the paddy field, trying to catch baby chicks running around and enjoyed looking at the stars at night with the complete silence of being away from the city. The big family and sense of community make this simple life fun and peaceful.",

      "Growing up in Greece, I knew that I was lucky to grow up in Greece with the beautiful nature and beaches, but I feel like many people never heard of Sri Lanka and wouldn't consider it as a vacation spot which is sad. I've lived in Sri Lanka for some years and although the country looks small in a globe; anywhere you go is beautiful. Sri Lanka doesn't get enough appreciation and gets overlooked by other popular options like Maldives or Thailand, but Sri Lanka has the potential to be a great tourist spot.",
